Customer Churn
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition,is when a customer chooses to stop using products or services of a company. But with each customer who churns, there are usually early indicators or metrics that can have been uncovered with churn analysis.
For example, The Telecom Industry faces a lot of Churn(With annual churn rate of 15-25%) because the customers can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from existing to another.

While looking at both Business operational insights (e.g. declining repeat purchases, reduced purchase quantity) and Customer experience insights along the customer feedbacks is foundational in order to predict churn. A scenario where a customer who has declined in recent visits and gives a feedback score of 6 of 10 after their latest shopping experience, could have an increased probability of churning.

Generally in a business perspective it costs more to acquire new customers than it does to retain existing customers. In fact, an increase in customer retention of just 5% can create at least a 25% increase in profit. This is because returning customers will likely spend 60% more on a company's products and services. As a result, the company can spend less on the operating costs of having to acquire new customers by spending time and money on convincing an existing customer to select your company over competitors because they've already made their mind.

However, if a company could forecast why and which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it can focus on customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. This helps in achieving the goal of expanding its customer base and retrieve more customers loyalty.
